# Unix Shell
By: Jonathan Argumedo & Julio Hernandez

## Objective

The purpose of this lab is no simulate the behaviour of a real shell terminal in C.

### How to run

A Makefile has been created to facilitate the execution of the shell program. At this time there 
are three ways to achieve this.

```
1. On a terminal launch the shell by using the 'make' command.
    This approach will launch a seperate window and simulates a real shell.
    In addition, this approach assumes that you are using a linux machine.
    If this is not the case use method 2 or 3.

2. On a terminal launch the shell by using the 'make light' command.
    This method will complile and launch the C program on the current terminal.

3. On a terminal use the command "make shell".
    This is compile the code and you can launch the program by using the './shell'
    command.

In addition you also have the option to export a PS1 variable before you launch the Shell.
You can achive this by writing:

* export PS1= "Julio"
* This will replace the default '$' symbol

In order to clean use the 'make clean' command.
```

### How to use
The shell was designed to do everything a real unix terminal can do.

```
Some examples include:
* ls -la                (List directory and permissions)
* find /etc -print &    (initiates a background task)
* ls > /tmp/files.txt   (Redirection of input and output)
* ls | sort -r          (Simple pipe that sorts the directory)
* exit                  (To exit the shell)
* sfafsafsafdas         (invalid commands will receive an error message)
```
